# Switch Problem

Numberphile posed an interesting mathematical riddle in this video:

I didn't know the answer so I paused the video and wrote a little application in Python to get to the final answer before watching it and learning the actual maths behind it.

This is actually a fun little beginner programming task. Hence I also wrote a C (I am a C guy) and Rust implementation, which I will teach on my channel.
