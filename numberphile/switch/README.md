# Switch Problem

Numberphile posed an interesting mathematical riddle in this video:

I didn't know the answer so I paused the video and wrote a little application in Python to get to the final answer before watching it and learning the actual maths behind it.

This is actually a fun little beginner programming task. It will also see if a developer knows about bitwise operations. You can efficiently toggle those lightswitches on and off without incurring a branching action by using an XOR. The method I used for the switching logic.
