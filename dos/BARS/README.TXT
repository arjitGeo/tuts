Tutorial on how to draw RASTER BARS
on VGA in DOS (x86 assembler)

RASTER.ASM
Is the foundation of rasterbars on VGA.
It shows the basic principle of drawing a single raster line.

RASTER2.ASM
This will actually draw a bar in a single color BAR_WIDTH lines wide

RASTER3.ASM
Will shade a raster bar using a lookup table, that describes a gradient

RASTER4.ASM
Will move the shaded raster bar up and down following a sine wave, that is
described in a precalculated table
