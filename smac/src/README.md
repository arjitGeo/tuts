## Introduction Zig

Please bear in mind that Zig is a new language and a lot is moving.
These examples were build on 0.11 version, so please buid the code with 0.11, there's no guarantee that this code will remain working!
As the Zig team is also very clear that Zig is NOT production ready at this point.
I now already seen massive differences between 0.10 and 0.11!
